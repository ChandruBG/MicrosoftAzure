#### You can find my introduction to the Azure API Management in this repository:
[Azure API Management - jump start](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/MicrosoftAzure/blob/master/AzureApiManagament/AzureApiManagementJumpStart.pdf)

#### Additional information:

###### First, create Azure API Management service:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance

## Overview of APIM in the Azure portal 

Once Azure API Management service is ready you should receive e-mail notification.

You can find it in the Azure Portal:

Please note that there are two URL addresses on the right side:

1. Developer portal URL - portal where developers can subscribe to the APIs managed by Azure API Management
2. Gateway URL - this is just a main address and entry point to all APIs handled by Azure API Management

We will start from the adding new Product.

## Create new API Management Product

*APIM product - a product contains one or more APIs as well as a usage quota and the terms of use. You can include a number of APIs and offer them to developers through the Developer portal. For more information, see Create and publish a product.*
